This is me NOW but this is not how it all started.

**I’ve been where you’re at.**

I felt confused about everything in marketing and sought for advice everywhere. Then I lost my confidence in everything because I was running from idea to the other, having the attention span of a goldfish. I felt stuck and needed a strategy. I felt totally lost and frustrated without a plan to follow. I know I’m dedicated if I have a plan but without a strategy? It’s like a goldfish congress in my head.

Are you feeling confused about everything in marketing? Does it even affect your confidence as a professional? You are not alone, it was totally ME a few years ago.

Are you feeling stuck because you have this deep fear that everything you have reached is just based on luck and all your clients found you by accident? Oh, this is what I was always ranting about to my friends.

You feel desperate that this whole business thing never gets easier and it always requires hard work to get new clients? THIS is what my biggest struggle was!

If you feel frustrated and you are afraid of wasting time on marketing efforts, I have to tell you, I KNOW how you feel.

This was me.

Then I had a clear plan, a structure in my life and it started to feel much easier to come up with content ideas, doing the networking thingy and I gained back my confidence in my business.

I felt relieved.

If you ever felt frustrated and stuck, although you had an awesome product/service, this is it, this is our story!

## My whole story…

When I started my business, it wasn’t an easy beginning. I was like ‘okay, my job is not bad, I can do it for a bit longer, I’ll focus on my dreams later, why the rush?”. Then I got stuck. And I felt lost and overwhelmed. And I needed some help to get over this frustration.

Luckily, I had (and still have) very supportive friends, and some of them being coaches and consultants themselves helped a lot. I realised, without their professional help, I couldn’t have done it. So, here I am, doing what I lOVE.


Help is crucial so I’m very happy that I can work in the supporting field – I support your business with my marketing approach. I’m just staying in the background, you are the hero of your business.

I have been an entrepreneur for 15+ years but for many years I was just a so-called entrepreneur, **I didn’t have the right mindset, I was just doing okay(ish) and that was enough(ish).** I didn’t use all my potentials. I was teaching English and Pilates (I know, I know, two totally different fields but they were a perfect mix for me, when I was tired of one, I did the other – different people, different location, and Pilates is a good change after sitting for hours). It was ideal. Or at least, I thought it was ideal.


However, I was overworking myself and I was very, very close to a burnout. Then even closer and finally I had to stop working because a serious burnout. I was devastated, I felt drained physically and mentally.

But I had to get up. After this, I started to be more open for changes, I knew I needed a new working style. But I kept going.

After a while, whenever I went to workshops and courses to learn more about teaching or fitness, I got questions from my colleagues about how I do this and that on my website. Or how did I come up with certain ideas in my biz? And they often asked the contact of my marketing girl. Surprised AF, I always said I was my marketing girl.

Long story short, after a while I realized, I spend more time giving marketing advice than on my actual work. So this was a turning point. What if I go back to my origins?

Because guess what? I learned marketing right after high school I was just too obsessed with the idea of teaching (I still love teaching) that I put it away for a while and used my knowledge only as extra help in my entrepreneur journey.

I have a degree in English Literature, many certifications in fitness but after realizing that my old knowledge is so useful for others, I decided to go back to school to learn more about marketing. I learnt more and more about successful online marketing and I talked to people with booming businesses and those with almost bankrupt bones to gain more info about the ups and downs of a business.

My certs look cool but real life experiences matter even more.

Because of my burnout I was more open to see the mistakes we, entrepreneurs tend to make. It taught me a lot. This is why I decided to focus more on minimalism than sitting on the trend of hassling and showing how busy I am all the time. My burnout also taught me the very important things in life, that a balance is necessary and it totally changed my view about work. I can see it now where we waste time and where we should put more attention. I choose to focus on working smart rather than hard. Okay, I work hard but in a focused manner, when and where I need to and the rest is for my family and friends. And for peeping all the cats and dogs on Instagram. And hedgehogs. I love hedgehogs, too. Oh, and donkeys!
